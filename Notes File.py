# math commands:
# x+y is addition
# x-y is subtraction
# x*y is multiplication
# x/y is division
# x<=y is x is less than or equal to y
# x>=y is x is greater than or equal to y
# x==y is x is equal to y
# x<y is x is less than y
# x>y is x is greater than y
# x%y is to find the remainder
# x**y is x to the power of y
# x+=y is adding x to y permanently (used in loops usually)
# x!=y is x doesn't equal y
# useful terminal commands: 
# "python": runs the python command with the same starting digit
# "clear" : clears the termial to make it look cleaner
# "echo" : echoes text into the terminal
# Variable types: 
# int=integer (number only)
# str=string (words and numbers allowed but cant be used for math) 
# float= a floating integer (useful for precise calculations)
# github commands:
# git add "(file name)"   (adds a file to the repository)
# git commit -m "(share comment on changelog)"  (tells you what you changed)
# git push -u origin main   (pushes the new version to the repository)
# git pull --all    (pulls any new versions from the repository to your computer)
# git cd "(name of repository)"   (needed to run a command in the repsoitory file instead of the file it is located in)
# git clone     (creates a copy of your repository that you can edit)
# Main imports:
# time is useful for using the sleep command and it basically has a timer
# random is good to pull something out of a range of data or numbers
# Coding Commands:
# if/elif/else is used to make toggles
# def is used to define an object
# class is used when importing other files to define what you want to import
# input allows the user to make inputs using the console
# print makes it write into the console
# break is used to stop a loop
# for (x) in (y) is a loop that decides for every x that is contained in y you loop the code
# while (x) is a loop that is permanent until x changes
# range (x, y, z) is a range from x-y will z as your steps (y and z default to one)
# == means that it is equal for checks while = means it is equal for defining
